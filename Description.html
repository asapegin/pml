<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To solve the task, I trained my model
in two different ways â€“ using Random Forest and Naive Bayes
approaches. The authors of the paper mentioned on the dataset
description page achieved quite a high accuracy using Random Forest
approach. However, I was curious, how Naive Bayes will perform in
comparison with their method.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The training of Naive Bayes without any
pre-processing has shown 0.775 accuracy with 0.7119 Kappa. I tried to
improve it using pre-processing with PCA and reached 0.7822 accuracy
with 0.7267 Kappa. To further improve it, I resampled the data and
used 99% of the dataset for the training. This helped to improve the
model again, but only up to 0.799 accuracy and 0.7474 Kappa.<BR><BR>80%
accuracy is quite a good result for the prediction based on Naive
Bayes. However, the Random Forest approach showed 0.9995 accuracy and
0.9994 Kappa.<BR><BR>Predictions from Naive Bayes model:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So, 4 of 20 predictions are different
for these models, which exactly corresponds to the proportion of
accuracy of 2 models (0.99 for Random Forest, 0.79 for Naive Bayes)</P>

confusion matrices in the repository for further details.</P>
